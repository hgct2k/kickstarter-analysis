Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project utilizes excel to analyze a Kickstarter campaign's result based on their launch date and funding goals.  This project required the review and manipulation of data using pivot tables, formulas, and conditional formatting.  Additionally, graphs were created to visualize trends.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visualize campaign outcomes from previous Kickstart campaigns using funding goals and launch date as variables.			

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The Theatre outcomes based on launch date shows the number of campaigns typically increase in warmer months such as May to August.  The chart is also midleading because there are a larger number of campaigns in May; however, the rate of success is similar to other months.  May's success rate is 66.86% while June's success rate is 65.35%

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The graph shows a decrease in successful campaigns as the goals get larger.  The opposite relationship is true where the percentage of campaign failures increase as the goals increase.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were not too many challenges or difficulties encountered.  A possible issue one could face is there could be a typo in your formula which could alter the visualization.  If it references the wrong column, the numbers would be inaccurate.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) There are a larger number of campaigns launched in May
2) Launching a campaign in December will have equal chance of success and failure

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1) The larger the goal, the more likely it will fail

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesn't provide much information about how the data was gathered.  It would be helpful to have some background to get a better understanding of possible limitations.

Additionally, I'd like to understand more about the globalization of the data.  Some data had diffrent currencies, but all the goals and pledged amount was in USD.  The data collected could possibly be more representative of US campagins.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other tables or graphs could include a heat map to show the quantity and location of campaigns.  Another graph could include a bull curve or standard deivation graph to show the spread of data to show how it is clustered based on the mean of the goal.
